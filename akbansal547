# No-Maj's Wand

## Summary

I have always been a huge fan of Harry Potter! I was always fascinated seeing the characters use their wands to cast spectacular spells. So i would be building an Arduino/ESP32 based project to replicate some of the functionalities of such wands using speech recognition & IOT. The wand would basically act like a voice controlled home automation system that can fit into a wand.

## Plan

I would be first using an ESP32/ Arduino connected to Google Assistant as the master device that would recognise the various voice commands/ spells. This would be connected to many other slave Nodemcu(s) that can control individual devices in accordance with the commands. One of the slave devices would also feature 3 TENS electrodes that can deliver tiny electric shocks for an exciting wand duel. The microcontrollers together would be able to accomplish a variety of tasks like the Lightning Spell (Lumos), The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) & variety of other wand dueling spells & charms.
